	<p style="font-size:14px; margin-left:5em; margin-right:10em; line-height: 1.2"> Abstract: This study investigates the impact of host race and gender on Airbnb property prices. I use an existing dataset of Airbnb listings and visually inspect 70,000 host profile pictures to code host demographics. I estimate that Asian hosts earn 4–5%, and Black male hosts 3%, less than White males for the same type of property. However, controlling for more observables weakens the effects, requiring a cautious interpretation of these point estimates. I use two proxies for the number of bookings a listing has to estimate whether a demand or supply shift is responsible for the price disparity. I find that despite the lower prices they charge for listings, minority hosts face lower demand. These findings are consistent with, but not conclusive of, the presence of discrimination.</p>

	<p style="font-size:14px; margin-left:5em; margin-right:10em; line-height: 1.2">This paper answers several first-order questions about ridesharing taxes: (i) How elastic is ridesharing with respect to taxation? (ii) How effective are ridesharing taxes at addressing traffic-related externalities? And (iii), who bears the burden of ridesharing taxes? Using data from Chicago, I show that ridesharing demand is inelastic in gross terms, and relative to supply. Accordingly, 85% of the city’s tax falls on passengers. Consistent with inelastic demand, I find little evidence of changes in congestion or air pollution in US cities that recently imposed ridesharing taxes. Finally, ridesharing taxes are roughly as progressive as the federal income tax schedule.</p>

	<p style="font-size:18px; font-family: TimesNewRoman; color: black" > Tarduno, Matthew, 2020. <em>What drives support for inefficient environmental policies?</em> <br><span style="color: #808080">Berkeley Law, Economics, and Politics Center Working Paper.</span>
	<p style="margin-left:3em">[<a href="https://matt-tarduno.github.io/nevada/" target="_blank">link</a>]
	<p style="font-size:14px; margin-left:5em; margin-right:10em; line-height: 1.2"> Negative externalities are often regulated with performance standards (e.g., fuel economy standards) where economic theory suggests that price-based mechanisms (e.g., fuel taxes) offer a more efficient alternative. The relative popularity of performance-based policies  is puzzling: 
	Given the cost-effectiveness of Pigouvian taxation and the ability of governments to pair these policies with redistribution, it should be possible to construct a price-based regulation that dominates a performance-based alternative on at least one of the three dimensions of efficacy, fairness, or cost, holding fixed the others. 
		In this paper, I use an information provision experiment to understand what drives differences in voter support for these two policy types. Specifically, this experiment allows me to answer two questions: How do voters' perceptions of policy cost, effectiveness, and regressivity influence policy support? And do misperceptions of policy attributes explain the relative popularity of nontax corrective policies? Preliminary results from a pilot experiment conducted around a 2020 energy ballot initiative suggest that voters overestimate the effectiveness of performance-based policies at reducing carbon emissions. Oaxaca-blinder decompositions, however, suggest that differences in beliefs about policy attributes explain only a quarter of the difference in support for performance vs. price-based policies. As a result, neither rectifying misperceptions about policy attributes, nor redesigning price-based policies to compensate swing voters appear likely to significantly bolster support for price-based corrective policies. 	</p>
